    <p> 
    As a highly motivated and dedicated person with a keen for software development, I am ambitious to start on a career as a junior software developer.
During my time in college, I pursued my BSc and MSc in Computer Science, where I learned programming languages such as C, C++, VisualBasic, Java and JavaScript. My degrees exposed me to various aspects of software development, including networking, data structure and software testing.
As an avid learner, I continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge in software development. Recently I joined Just IT software development bootcamp, in which I have expanded my knowledge on the latest technologies and software such as HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, GitHub, SQL workbench and SQLite. 
I am confident that my enthusiasm, adaptability, and determination will assist me to shine in a software development role. I am eagerly waiting to work with a team of experienced developers and learn from their expertise.
